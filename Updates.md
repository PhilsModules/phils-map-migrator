# Changelog

## v1.2.1 - Sorting & Stability Update

*   **Improved Sorting:** Scene list now sorts by name first, then by folder code (numbers before letters).
*   **Case Insensitive Sorting:** Fixed sorting issues where "Attack of" and "Attack Of" were separated.
*   **Translation Fixes:** Added missing German translations and fixed typos.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Resolved syntax errors and improved overall stability.

## v1.2.0 - Compact UI & Enhanced Workflow

This update focuses on usability and safety improvements:

*   **Compact UI:** The window is now significantly smaller and cleaner, taking up less screen space.
*   **Folder/List Toggle:** You can now switch between a folder-based view and a flat list view for map selection.
*   **Backup Safety:** Added a "Create Backup" checkbox. When checked, the target scene will be cloned before any data is migrated, ensuring you never lose work.
*   **Natural Sorting:** Scene lists now use natural sorting (1, 2, 10 instead of 1, 10, 2).
*   **Better Visibility:** The "Map Migrator" button has been moved to the header of the Scene Directory and given a distinct blue style.
