[1.3.0] Map Adjuster Feature

This update introduces the **Map Adjuster**, a powerful tool to fix offsets after migration, and significantly improves the module's documentation.

New Features:
* MAP ADJUSTER: A graphical interface to move and scale Pins (Notes) and Tokens (Enemies) pixel-perfectly.
   * Access it via the new "Fix" button in the Migrator.
   * "Move" Control: Uses arrow keys for precise X/Y adjustment.
   * "Scale" Control: Uses "Squish/Stretch" buttons to adjust spacing between grouped objects.
   * Supports selection of only Pins, only Tokens, or both.
* LOCALIZATION: Full English and German support for the new tool.

Documentation:
* Redesigned README matching the style of my other modules.
* Added clear instructions for the new Adjuster tool.
